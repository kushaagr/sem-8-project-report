        <h2>Abstract </h2>
        <p>The purpose of this project is to create an ever-online system where
        any faculty can view all the occured activites or events. These events are
        either ones where students from college participated in any outside event or
        events which were hosted by students.

        A system which can keep record in a chronological manner, is always 
        available (online) and provides easy interface to edit and create more 
        entries.

                <span class="main-heading">Brief Description</span>
                <p> The “Leave  Management System” has been developed to override  the  problems
                prevailing  in the practicing manual system. This software   is supported to 
                eliminate and in some cases reduce the hardships faced by this existing system. 
                Moreover this system is designed for the particular need of the company to 
                carry out operations in a smooth and effective manner.
                The application is reduced as much as possible to possible to avoid errors 
                while entering the data. It also provides error message while entering invalid 
                data. It also provides error message while entering invalid data. No formal 
                knowledge is needed for the user to use this system. Thus by this all it 
                proves it is user friendly. Leave Management System, as described above, can 
                lead to error free, secure, reliable and fast management system. It can assist 
                the user to concentrate in their other activities rather to concentrate on the 
                record keeping. Thus it will help organization in better utilization of 
                resources. </p>

                        this feasibility study, we studied complete functionality to be 
                        provided in the system, as described in the System Requirement 
                        Specification (SRS), and checked if everything was possible using 
                        different type of frontend and backend platforms.

                        This is a very important aspect to the considered while developing a 
                        project. We decided the technology based on minimum possible cost 
                        factor.

                            <li>Overall we have estimated that the benefits the organization 
                            is going to receive from the proposed system will surely overcome 
                            the initial costs and the later on running cost for system.</li>

                        <p>No doubt the proposed system is fully GUI based that is very user 
                        friendly and all inputs to be taken all self-explanatory even to a 
                        layman. Besides, a proper training has been conducted to let know 
                        the essence of the system to the users so that they feel comfortable 
                        with new system. As far our study is concerned the clients are 
                        comfortable and happy as the system has cutdown their loads and

                        <span class="sub-heading">existing system</span>
                        <p>In the existing manual system of leave management in educational 
                        institutions, if the members of the faculty need to apply for a 
                        leave, they are supposed  to submit a leave application to the HOD 
                        concerned. After receiving consent from the HOD concerned, the 
                        applicant needs to submit the leave application to the principal for 
                        further approval. If the HOD or the Principal is not, then the 
                        member of faculty can’t get consent for their leave application. 
                        Also the retrieval of information like the number f leave available 
                        becomes a cumbersome task as it requires scanning of the entire 
                        record.

                        <span class="sub-heading">Proposed System</span>
                        <p>By considering the pros and cons of the existing system, this 
                        application has been developed to cover all the features and 
                        overcomes the cons of the existing system. In the proposed system of 
                        Online Leave Management System, the registered members of faculty 
                        can simply generates a leave request anywhere and anytime providing 
                        the required details. The leave request thus generated is sent to 
                        the HOD concerned for consideration which can be approved or 
                        rejected. In case of approval by the HOD concerned. The leave 
                        request is automatically forwarded to the Principal can access he 
                        leave applications delivered to them anywhere and anytime. Also the 
                        members of faculty can view their leave account without going 
                        through the entire record. By availing the benefits of this app, 
                        members of faculty and HOD can generate leave requests and get them 
                        approved even in the case of absence of required authorities. This 
                        project enhances security to the leave records of faculties.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p> The system has completed its first phase: design and prototyping.
        With design down, the system can now move to final development phase.
        There are many nuances yet to be thought over but the overall problem and 
        solution is now concrete.</p>
